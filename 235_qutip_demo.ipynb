    " * Say the Hamiltonian $\\delta H$ changes on a time scale $\\tau$ which is large compared to the natural time scale for the unperturbed system, $\\frac{\\hbar}{E_a - E_b}$. Then the transition probabilities go to zero! This is a manifestation of the *adiabatic theorem* -- if you drag the Hamiltonian from one place to another slowly, you drag a system from the $n$-th eigenstate of the beginning Hamiltonian to the $n$-th eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian slowly (up to phase!). Very interesting physics here! Look up geometrical phase and dynamical phase, for example.\n",
    " * Say the time scale for the Hamiltonian, $\\tau$, is very small compared to other time scales in the problem. Then the transition amplitudes again go to zero! The perturbation is \"too fast\" for the system to react.\n",
    " * Finally, what if we ignore the time dependence and look at the matrix elements $\\delta H_{ab}$. If those guys vanish, then the transition amplitude will be zero, unconditional on the driving frequency. This is the idea of a *selection rule*, and often reflect deep symmetries of the problem. For example, in hydrogen, an electric field can only induce transitions where $L_z$ changes by $1$ unit, to first order, since the photon is a spin one particle!\n",
